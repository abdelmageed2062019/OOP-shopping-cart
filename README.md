The OOP Shopping Cart project is a simple yet comprehensive example of applying object-oriented concepts to create a modular and scalable shopping cart system. It includes classes and methods that represent items, a shopping cart, and user interactions.

Features
Object-Oriented Design: The project follows OOP principles, providing a clear and extensible structure.
Item Management: Easily add, remove, or modify items in the shopping cart.
User Interaction: Simulate user actions such as adding items to the cart, viewing the cart, and checking out.
Modular and Extensible: The code is organized into classes, making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones.
